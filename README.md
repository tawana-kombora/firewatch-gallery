# Practice makes a proffesional 
I would not call myself a proffesioinal yet. I know a bit of html, a bit of css, and not nearly enough javascript - and this presents a problem.
Why?
Simple: I want to be competent... no more than competency I want to be an expert. 
Doing these 'projects' helps me with that. Though i would advise anyone doing tutorials and practising their skills to type everything out. In fact don't just type it out.
Think about it. 
Reason about it. 
After all all software jobs are really thinking jobs in disguise.
