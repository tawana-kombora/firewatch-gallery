# Practice makes a proffesional 

I would not call myself a proffesioinal yet. 
I know a bit of html, a bit of css, and not nearly enough javascript - and this presents a problem.

Why?
Simple: I want to be competent.
No, more than competency I want to be an expert!

Doing these projects increases my competency. 
Think about it. 
Reason about it.
-- software jobs are thinking jobs'
